## Library
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}

data1 <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))
str(data1)

data1$date <- ymd(data1$date)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
totalSteps <- aggregate (steps ~ date, data = data1, FUN = sum, na.rm=TRUE)
head(totalSteps)
```

1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
hist(totalSteps$steps, xlab = "Steps", main = "Steps / Day", breaks = 10, col = "blue")
```

2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean(totalSteps$steps)
median(totalSteps$steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
